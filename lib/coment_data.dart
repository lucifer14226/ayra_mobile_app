  "Worth reading, I haven't yet finished it as I am taking the chapters slowly and implementing it at the same time, so it's taking time to complete, quality self help book with quotes to live by... Lessons taught with stories of both successful and failed people, this was what I liked the most about this book.",
  "I love the part where there's mention of Malala's journey and shown how courageous she was and how she chose not to suffer….it’s just empowering…glad I choose to read this.",
  "I like it for its casual style of diagnosing and curing the most common life style difficulties that need rare but effective treatment.I recommend this book to working class, aspirants of wishful jobs and guys who want to live life - their own.I thank the writer to make the extract of bitter books in shape of cold coffee without any f*ck."
